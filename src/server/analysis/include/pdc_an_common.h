 * would never learn where an output belongs until the first read of it,
 * and write-triggered eager computation (which needs to know that before
 * the triggering write completes) would silently degrade to read-triggered
 * lazy computation for every multi-object graph. So a transfer RPC that
 * touches any part of a graph piggybacks this rank's *entire* known set of
 * attachments for that graph -- every input and output state's binding --
 * not just the one region this particular RPC happens to touch. The
 * server-side registration is idempotent (PDCan_store_attach_mapping), so
