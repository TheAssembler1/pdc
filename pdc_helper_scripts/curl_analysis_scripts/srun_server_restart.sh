# Restart pdc_server for this job's node count, passing the `restart`
# argument so it reloads the metadata checkpoint written when
# srun_close_server.sh closed the previous server instance -- see
# PDC_Server_restart / PDC_Server_checkpoint in src/server/pdc_server.c.
# Used between each posthoc phase so the next phase talks to a server
# process that genuinely had to reload persisted data, not one that just
# kept it in memory the whole time. Unlike srun_server.sh, this does NOT
# wipe $PDC_DATA_LOC first -- that would delete the checkpoint it's about
# to read.
#
# Required env: BIN_DIR, NUM_NODES, SERVERS_PER_NODE, SERVER_TOTAL_TASKS,
#   LOG_TAG
