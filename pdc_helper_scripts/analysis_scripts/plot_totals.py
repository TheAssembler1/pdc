"""
Stacked-bar comparison of total workload time across the magnitude-
analysis benchmark modes (eager DataFlyway, lazy DataFlyway, posthoc PDC,
posthoc HDF5), reconstructed from this directory's results_<mode>_*.csv
files. Run extract_close_times.py first (or after) so avg_close_s /
total_with_close_s are populated -- see README.md's "Result CSV schema"
section for why that column matters for an HDF5-comparable total.

Each results CSV has one row per timestep (N_TIMESTEPS=3 in the C
benchmarks), with two kinds of columns: per-timestep costs that really
happen three times (write_s, readback_s, compute_s, writeback_s) and
one-time job-level costs that are just repeated on every row for CSV
convenience (setup_s / write_setup_s / analyze_setup_s, relaunch_s,
avg_close_s). Reconstructing one job's true wall-clock "total workload
time" means summing the former across every timestep row and taking the
latter once, not 3x -- that's what aggregate() below does before
stacking. Segments that are always zero for a given mode (e.g. eager's
readback_s/compute_s/writeback_s, folded into write_s instead -- see
README.md) are dropped from that mode's stack instead of drawing an
empty slice.

eager's confirm_read_s (the post-write read that confirms DataFlyway
actually materialized magnitude server-side -- see bench_magnitude.c)
is deliberately excluded from both the stack and the total: it's a
correctness check for this benchmark, not part of the workload being
timed, and folding it into eager's total would inflate it against the
other modes for a cost they don't pay either.

Bars are colored by cost segment (one color per segment, shared across
modes) and outlined by workload -- eager/lazy/posthoc/hdf5 each get a
distinct, solid edge color -- rather than using hatch texture to tell
modes apart, so segment identity and workload identity are two
independent visual channels.
