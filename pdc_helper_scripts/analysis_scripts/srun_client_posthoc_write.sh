# Posthoc benchmark, phase 1: run bench_write_components, which writes
# vx/vy/vz as plain PDC objects (no graph attached) and exits. Every
# client rank from this srun step fully terminates before phase 2
# (srun_client_posthoc_analyze.sh) launches as a separate step, against a
# server that's been closed and restarted in between (see
# posthoc_analysis.sbatch) -- that relaunch is the part that makes this a
# real posthoc workflow instead of lazy's single continuous session.
#
# Required env: BIN_DIR, NUM_NODES, CLIENTS_PER_NODE, CLIENT_TOTAL_TASKS,
#   N_ELEM, LOG_TAG, WRITE_LOG
